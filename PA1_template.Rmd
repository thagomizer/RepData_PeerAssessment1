## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
if (!file.exists("activity.zip")) {
  download.file(url = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip", destfile = "activity.zip", method = "curl")
  }

if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) {
  unzip ("activity.zip")
  }

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
